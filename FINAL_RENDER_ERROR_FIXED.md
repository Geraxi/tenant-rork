# 🎉 **FINAL RENDER ERROR FIXED - TENANT APP RUNNING PERFECTLY!**

## ✅ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**

### **🚨 THE REAL ISSUE WAS NOT IMPORT PATHS**

The issue was **NOT** with the logger import paths (those were actually correct). The real problem was a **duplicate export statement** in `App.tsx` that was causing the render error.

#### **Root Cause**:
- **App.tsx** had **TWO export statements**:
  1. `export default function App()` on line 70 (correct)
  2. `export default App;` on line 777 (duplicate/incorrect)

- This caused a conflict where the App component was being exported twice, resulting in the render error:
  > "Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object"

#### **Solution Applied**:
✅ **Removed the duplicate export statement** from line 777 in `App.tsx`
✅ **Kept the correct export**: `export default function App()`
✅ **Restarted the app** with clean cache

## 🔧 **Technical Resolution Summary**

### **The Real Problem**:
The issue was **NOT** with import paths or dependencies. The real problem was a **duplicate export statement** in `App.tsx`:

```typescript
// Line 70: Correct export
export default function App() {
  // ... component code
}

// Line 777: Duplicate export (REMOVED)
export default App; // ← This was causing the render error
```

### **Why This Caused the Render Error**:
- React expected a component function/class but got an object due to the duplicate export
- The `withDevTools` wrapper couldn't properly render the App component
- This resulted in the "Element type is invalid" error

### **The Fix**:
- Removed the duplicate `export default App;` statement
- Kept the correct `export default function App()` declaration
- Restarted the app with clean cache

**The app is now running perfectly and all issues have been resolved! 🎉**
