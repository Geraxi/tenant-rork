# üéâ **FINAL IMPORT RESOLUTION SUCCESS - TENANT APP RUNNING PERFECTLY!**

## ‚úÖ **ALL IMPORT PATHS COMPLETELY RESOLVED**

### **Issue**: Persistent Import Resolution Errors
- **Error**: `Unable to resolve module ../utils/logger from [various files]`
- **Problem**: Metro bundler was using cached information despite correct import paths
- **Fix**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETELY RESOLVED** - Cleared all caches and restarted with fresh state

### **Root Cause Analysis**:
The issue was not with the actual import paths in the files (which were already correct), but with Metro bundler's cache that was still referencing old, incorrect import paths. Even though all files had been updated to use the correct path `../src/utils/logger`, the bundler was still trying to resolve the old paths from its cache.

### **Solution Applied**:
1. ‚úÖ **Killed all processes** - Stopped all Expo, Metro, and Node processes
2. ‚úÖ **Cleared all caches** - Removed `node_modules/.cache` and `.expo` directories
3. ‚úÖ **Fresh restart** - Started with `--clear --reset-cache` flags
4. ‚úÖ **Verified resolution** - All import paths now resolve correctly

### **Files Verified with Correct Import Paths**:
1. ‚úÖ **screens/ProfiloScreen.tsx** - `import { logger } from '../src/utils/logger';`
2. ‚úÖ **screens/LoginScreen.tsx** - `import { logger } from '../src/utils/logger';`
3. ‚úÖ **screens/HomeScreen.tsx** - `import { logger } from '../src/utils/logger';`
4. ‚úÖ **screens/LeMieBolletteScreen.tsx** - `import { logger } from '../src/utils/logger';`
5. ‚úÖ **screens/MatchesScreen.tsx** - `import { logger } from '../src/utils/logger';`
6. ‚úÖ **screens/LandlordSwipeScreen.tsx** - `import { logger } from '../src/utils/logger';`
7. ‚úÖ **screens/PropertySwipeScreen.tsx** - `import { logger } from '../src/utils/logger';`
8. ‚úÖ **components/SwipeCard.tsx** - `import { logger } from '../src/utils/logger';`
9. ‚úÖ **components/BottomNavigation.tsx** - `import { logger } from '../src/utils/logger';`
10. ‚úÖ **components/ExpandableCardModal.tsx** - `import { logger } from '../src/utils/logger';`
11. ‚úÖ **components/MatchAnimation.tsx** - `import { logger } from '../src/utils/logger';`
12. ‚úÖ **App.tsx** - `import { logger } from './src/utils/logger';`

## üîß **Technical Resolution Summary**

### **Cache Issue Resolution**:
The final issue was a Metro bundler cache problem where the bundler was still referencing old import paths despite the files being correctly updated. This was resolved by:

1. **Complete process termination** - Killed all Expo, Metro, and Node processes
2. **Cache clearing** - Removed all cache directories (`node_modules/.cache`, `.expo`)
3. **Fresh restart** - Used `--clear --reset-cache` flags for a completely clean start
4. **Verification** - Confirmed all imports now resolve correctly

This demonstrates the importance of clearing caches when making significant import path changes in React Native/Expo projects.
