### **🚨 ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**

#### **1. Empty Component Files**

- **Fix**: Created proper React Native components with TypeScript interfaces
- **Result**: ✅ Import errors completely resolved

  - Removed `node_modules`, `.expo`, `node_modules/.cache`
  - Removed `package-lock.json`
  - Reinstalled all dependencies with `--legacy-peer-deps`
  - Fixed package versions with `npx expo install --fix`
  - Started app with `--clear --reset-cache` flags
- **Result**: ✅ All cache issues resolved

#### **4. Runtime Error: "TypeError: property is not configurable"**
- **Issue**: Corrupted dependencies and module conflicts
- **Fix**: Complete dependency reinstall and cache clearing
- **Result**: ✅ Runtime error completely resolved
